# Square Graham Partition Finder

This is a supplemenary for the paper 
"A Computational Approach to Square Graham Partitions"
by Byungchan Kim, Eunmi Kim, and Yoon Kyung Park.

Finder function tries to find a partition of $n$ of the form
$$n = \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \cdots + \lambda_\ell^2$$
and
$$1 = \frac{1}{\lambda_1} + \frac{1}{\lambda_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{\lambda_\ell}.$$
